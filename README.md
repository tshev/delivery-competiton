# Delivery optimization

It is a typical discrete optimization problem. This task is a simplification of a real-world problem. This package evaluates your solution. We use the same script for the final evaluation.



### Usage example:
```bash
pip install git+git://github.com/tshev/delivery-competiton.git
delivery_competition -i ./input/A.in -o ./ouput/A.out
```
This program prints the final score of your solution.
