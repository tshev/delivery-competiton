# Delivery optimization

It is a typical discrete optimization problem. This task is a simplification of a real-world problem. This package evaluates your solution. We use the same script for the final evaluation.

### Usage example:
```bash
pip3 install git+git://github.com/tshev/delivery-competiton.git
delivery_competition -i ./input/A.in -o ./ouput/A.out
delivery_competition -i ./input/B.in -o ./ouput/B.out
delivery_competition -i ./input/C.in -o ./ouput/C.out
```
This program prints the final score of your solution.

### Input files
There are 3 input files. You need to provide a solution for all of them. You can have different solutions for different files. We accept implementations in C++, C, Python, Java, C#, Python, Kotlin, Scala, Swift, Lua, Julia, JS, Rust, Go, D, Ruby, Haskell.
```
input/A.in
input/B.in
input/C.in
```
